IMPORTANT -
set environment variable $JAVA_HOME to the location of your installed JDK.
before building.

Building:
$make

Running:
$cd bin
$./proj3

Troubleshooting:
"ERROR: class not found !" - this indicates that the JVM cannot locate the
"ZooFileWriter.class" file. Solution is to either build again, or run
$make bin/ZooFileWriter.class

Unable to find jni.h - this indicates that the JAVA_HOME variable is not
pointed to a valid JDK installation. I have provided a default value,
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64, which is where Ubuntu installs openjdk 11
by default. If this is not your environment, you will need to set $JAVA_HOME
appropriately.

Unable to find libjvm - this indicates that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not include
your JDK environment. Solution is to set
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib:$JAVA_HOME/lib/server
